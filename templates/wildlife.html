  <h1> Welcome to my wildlife detection project <p>
    a.k.a.<p>
    Fauna-ing Over Object Detection</h1>
  I'm not going to copy my Github's README.md file or anything onto this page.
  This was meant more as an intro to the project and an explanation of research
  I did. I really just want you to click on the
  <a href="https://github.com/MasonCaiby/Boulder_AI_CPW_study" target="blank">github<img class="new-window" src='static/new_window.png' title="new tab" alt="opens in new tab"></a>
  link if you want some indepth results and a guide to my code.<p>

  I did this project in conjuction with
  <a href="https://www.boulderai.com/?gclid=CjwKCAjw0ujYBRBDEiwAn7BKt-dlv70__HYqtXFfbC2cZ58JN3UJqRZSG47TBgdAN3AWpzHhPkcJLxoCK2UQAvD_BwE" target="blank">BoulderAI<img class="new-window" src='static/new_window.png' title="new tab" alt="opens in new tab"></a>.
   It is an object detection model trained on wildlife images from
   <a href="http://image-net.org/" target="blank">Imagenet<img class="new-window" src='static/new_window.png' title="new tab" alt="opens in new tab"></a>.
   I had about a week to pipe, train, and evaluate the model. With this tight
   time constraint I was able to get the model to detect animals with a fair amount
   of accuracy (precision of 83%), but was unable to get the model to identify
   animal species. With more training time I am confident the model would
   identify some species correctly (due to the BW nature of the photos and the
   size of some animals I'm not sure it could differentiate between say, a robin
   and a sparrow).<p>
<p>
  I used TensorFlow's Faster-RCNN for this project. It allowed me to detect objects
  much faster than I could have with trianing a model ground up. This allowed me to
  start detecting animals after ~5 hours of training. I kept trying to tweak the model
  and what I was training it on to get it to classify the different species faster,
  but I think it might have just needed more time to train. I'm not really sure and
  object detection / classification is definetly something I'm interested in pursuing more.
  I have a few ideas of things I'll want to work on eventually. I'll probably
  start looking into this project and why I couldn't get classifications more when
  I start to work on those.<p>
    <p>
  This project was a great intro to object detetion and computer vision. I also
  learned a lot about AWS, Python's os package, scoping issues, and working with
  companies/customers under a tight time constraint. The project whetted my
  object detection appettite, and I look forward to some more projects coming in
  the future. So stay tuned and if you have any cool computer vision project ideas,
  or TensorFlow API questions, shoot them <a href="contact">my way!</font></u></a>
