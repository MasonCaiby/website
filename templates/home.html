  I'm not really sure why I led with that, I guess mainly so you don't judge
  this website too harshly. I was orginially going to just make the 'controls'
  page, but then just kinda kept going...<p>

  On a semi-related note, I don't think Atom encorporates spell check, which means
  I should run this through some other spell checker.<p>

  Anyway, as an about me: I climb and am into Data Science. That's kinda it.</div><p>

  I guess I'd like to say that I work hard and am really smart and like problem
  solving, but you and I both know that's what everyone says, so I won't say it.
  Everyone in Boulder seems to have a personal brand, I like Volcom pants I guess.
  I was going to develop and carefully curate a brand, but that just seemed kinda
  fake and I can typically see through those. I'm honestly just trying to impress
  my dad and get a dog, but that doesn't really seem like a brand.
  I'll leave it at:
