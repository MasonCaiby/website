<h1> Welcome to my Picnic Table project</h1>
<p class="lead"> This project is not complete, but it's functional enough.</p>
I had orginally planned to make the light controls password protected, and I
might add some buttons for presets. I have other priorities right now.<p>
This project was partially inspired by my girlfriend's desire for an outdoor
table,
<a href="https://github.com/timothy-salazar/light_controls" target="blank">TC's light project<img class="new-window" src='static/new_window.png' title="new tab" alt="opens in new tab"></a>.
and my desire to make cool things, and ability to reject any idea of scope
control.<p>
<p>
I'd like to thank TC for all of his help with the lights - I literally had no
idea what I was doing until it was done. If you have any questions about
anything Data Science or really any cool projects I'm sure he'd love to chat.
Try contacting him through his
<a href="https://github.com/timothy-salazar/" target="blank">Github.<img class='new-window' src='static/new_window.png' title="new tab" alt="opens in new tab"></a>.
I also need to thank Nick Smith and Kynan Waggoner for loaning me some
powertools and my girlfriend Marissa for letting me borrow her garage, and
putting up with me. <p>
All of these people are way better than me at everything.<p>
<p>
Anyway, the project here was to build a picnic table (for outdoor use and
storage) I went ahead and added the led lights to the bottom of the table
because I thought it wood (haha) look cool. Honestly, I did a lot of extra work
for aesthetics, and it still looks pretty bad. If you would like to replicate
this project, the details for the table are here, and for the LEDs and website
(also this entire site) can be found in my

<h3>The Table</h3>
<div align='left'>
I tried to take pictures as I went, but didn't do a very good job. Contact me
with questions if you have any.<p>
<p>
I probably over built this and would like to stress that doing this without a
table saw, bandsaw, and large miter saw is a huge pain. If you don't have access to
those tools (I didn't) I would suggest using L-bracket clamps like
<a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Knape-Vogt-Ultimate-Bracket-Titanium/dp/B002TII0JY/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1529358498&sr=8-1&keywords=KNAPE+%26+VOGT+208TI550+Hardware+Brackets" target="blank">these<img class="new-window" src='static/new_window.png' title="new tab" alt="opens in new tab"></a>
instead of the psuedo joinery I did. If you would like to suffer and have bad
joints, I used a skill saw with a 10" blade. If you can find a thinner one that will let
you cut a 4x4 (don't forget about clearing the board throught the up down
cycle of the blade), you might be better off. My blade was quite thick.<p>
  <p>
The first step is to get all of your wood. I made my table quite large (8 feet
long), so I'll just go off those measurements. I used full 2x6's for the
tops and 4x4's for everything else. Remember that timber dimensions are nominal.
A standard rule of thumb is that everything over 2" shrinks by 1/2". So a 2x6
is really a 1.5"x5.5" and a 4x4 is really a 3.5"x3.5". Also, if you're buying lumber,
there's a really really good chance the boards are warped, or slightly off in
size. People that do this a lot will typically look down the boards while they're
buying them at Home Depot. I can't say anything about other lumber yards; it
might be bad ettiquite, like rubbing chopsticks together at a fancy Japenese
Restraunt. My final dimesnison were:<br>
<h5>Table</h5>
&emsp;8' long x ~34" (6 2x6s) wide x ~31.5" high .
<h5>Benches (x2)</h5>
&emsp;7' long x ~ 11" wide x ~16.5" high (you should maybe make these a few inches taller)<p>
<p align='center'>

quantities of wood, I'll also have a shopping list at the bottom of this page.
If you want to change the sizes, you'll have to figure out
your wood needs, although I suspect they won't change much unless you trim
your length down to 5ish feet. I used
<a href="https://www.homedepot.com/p/Woodguard-2-in-x-6-in-x-8-ft-2-DF-Polymer-Coated-Western-Red-Cedar-Tone-Treated-Lumber-04-77-17803/301707975" target="blank">Home Depot's Red Cedar Pressure Treated Wood<img class="new-window" src='static/new_window.png' title="new tab" alt="opens in new tab"></a>.
for both the tops and bottoms (except in 4x4 for the bottom / base). You shouldn't
need pressure treated wood, as we'll end up coating it anyway, but I believe it's
best practice to use it.<p>
<h5 align='center'>10 4x4's and 10 2x6's</h5>
Make sure you get the best wood you can. You'll want to make sure it's level,
has good edges, and is dry (or you can leave it in your girlfriend's garage for
3 weeks, up to you).<p>
<p>
<h3 align='center'>Building The Table</h3>
<b>Step 1:</b> Cut the boards to length. I added a few inches to the height of the legs,
as mine are a little short.<p>
&emsp;The most obvious step is to cut all of your 2x6's with a miter saw.<p>
&emsp;&emsp;You want 4 at 7' and 6 at 8'<p>
&emsp;You'll also need to cut the 4x4's<p>

<h4>** You do the exact same thing for the table and benches, just with different
  lengths of everything, the pieces that you cut out will all be the same size. **</h4>
<p>
<b>Step 2:</b> Make the legs<p>
&emsp;You're going to want to make a post on the inside corner on each leg. This
way you can connect your width and length boards without screwing into end grain
ever. The corner with the post should be the worse corner (e.g. most rounded).
These cuts were a huge pain with a skill saw. I ended up starting the cuts with
a circular saw so the skill saw had to cut less wood. The post stub thing needs
to be 3.5" tall (the width of a 4x4), and 2" thick/wide. This will leave 1.5"
for the width and length boards.<br>

</div>

<div class="container">
  <div class="image-with-description">
    <p class="image-description"> <b>Step 3:</b> Make the Widths <br>
      These are also slightly complicated, but less so than the legs. you'll
      need to cut a rectangle out of each end, so the width can lay on top of the
       leg, and beside the post. You'll want the part that sticks out to be <b>3.5"
       long</b> and <b>1.5" wide</b>. I honestly think the picture describes it much better
       than I can with wordies. You need to make sure the rectangles you take
       out are on the same side of the board, and you'll want to leave the two
       best corners, the side opposite of the rectangle you take out (e.g. the
       one on the ground in this pic) will be the display side.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<b>Step 4:</b> Make the Lengths <br>
These are almost the exact same as the lengths, except the rectange you take out
should be <b>2" long</b> and <b>1.5" wide</b>. When you put the lengths and widths
together,you'll have a little <b>2" square</b> missing from the joint. They'll
look like this (but hopefully flush):

</div>

<b>Step 5:</b> Build the Base <br>
This part can be tricky, you need to asseble the whole thing. You want to make
sure you get all of your pieces together as tightly as possible, with right angles
between everything. I don't have some secret family trick for this, just a speed
square. I started by putting the widths onto the legs, then connecting the lengths.
It might be smarter to connect the lengths and widths with

Up to you.<p>
<p>
Once assembled, everything should look like this, except not painted:<br>

<div align="center">
<img src="static/table_pictures/table_no_top.JPG" alt="Table without the top." style="height:410px; width:606px;  margin:10px; border-radius:15px;">
</div>
<p>

Ok sweet, you did the hard parts.<p>

<div class="container">
  <div class="image-with-description">
    <p class="image-description"> <b>(Optional) Step 6:</b> Add L braces
I added L-braces to the table, my legs had a little play I didn't like. I don't
think it'll make a difference when you add these (I put them on after I painted,
then painted over them).</p>
<img src="static/table_pictures/table_with_l_braces.JPG" alt="Top down view, without a leg 2" style="height:326; width:244px; margin:10px; border-radius:15px;"><br>
  </div>
</div><p>

<b>Step 7:</b> Paint the Base <br>
I used
<a href="https://www.zoro.com/rust-oleum-enamel-alkyd-black-flat-7776502/i/G9973765/feature-product?gclid=CjwKCAjwj4zaBRABEiwA0xwsP2Kk4mm-aYLHHsQOSUS1ePTLjF8rMco28t2wgTnr8zvlCBc1YR3dyRoCm34QAvD_BwE" target="black">Rust-Olem Matte Black<img class="new-window" src='static/new_window.png' title="new tab" alt="opens in new tab"></a>
paint, since it will help waterproof the bases. I also like matte black things.
You should use a nicer quality brush, and definetly need to buy (or have) some
Mineral Spirits around to clean up after yourself, since it's waterproof paint
you can't just wash it off.
