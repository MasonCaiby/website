  <h1> Welcome to my SO_Handler project</h1>
  <p class="lead"></p>
  Please take a look at the existing
  <a href="https://github.com/MasonCaiby/so_handler" target="_blank">github repo<img class="new-window" src='static/new_window.png' title="new tab" alt="opens in new tab"></a>
  for this project.<p>
<div align='left'>
I started this project in February of this year, got busy with other things, and
recently started revisiting it some. Right now I am pretty happy with everything
except the R-CNN (though I think it's close). I am interested in maybe building a
<a href='https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/reports/2762063.pdf' target='blank'>Gated LSTM<img class="new-window" src='static/new_window.png' title="new tab" alt="opens in new tab"></a>
But will probably wait until I have a job to train this Neural Net much more,
I'm starting to run out of AWS credits and want to build a Deep Learning computer
at some point in time, but those look like theyll run me about $1000-$2000.<p>
<p>
Anyways, this does a few things:
<ol><li>Pulls an image of a dog from Flickr</li>
<li>Generates a text snippet via an R-CNN model (with LSTM) trained on Terry
        Pratchett's Thief of Time</li>
<li>Puts these together in an email and sends it to the email address I give it</li>
</ol><p>
  <p>

<p>
<p>
As you can tell, I took this picture with text generated from an old model.
I was orignially going to generate love poems with this, but I decided that Terry
Pratchett was a better use of everyone's time.<p>
  <p>
The email is sent by running a program which calls a the different parts and
sends them to a function that builds the email.

First it makes a Terry Pratchett text snippet from the RCNN. I have 4 LSTM Layers,
with a 50% dropout after every epoch. It took about 51 epochs to start getting good
results - I want to train it for about 50 more, I'll probably work on that soon.<br>
&emsp; Because I'm training the model on AWS and wanted to monitor the model's
progress, I added an email function. I train the model for a single epoch (loading
the data in takes a significant minority of the training time), save the model and
predict on some randomly pulled text from the training set. This text is then
sent to my email so I can see it from my phone. I also get the epoch number
the model is on. <p>
<p>
It then pulls an image from Flickr. Flickr has an API that lets you pass tags to it
and get images back. I'm going to be honest, I read just enough to get this working
and there might be better ways to do this. I have the tags set to shuffle, but
it always pulled the last one I had in my list (Border Collies fwiw), so I shuffle
the list of tags everytime I call the flickr_scraper. I also wanted to make sure
I sent original pictures. To do this I made a text file called "sent_images.txt"
and save the Flickr picture name to this file. I then pull a picture and make sure
it's name is not in the file.<p>
<p>
Next I pass everything to the email function I built. This builds and sends an
email using MIME and an opened Gmail account. I made this pretty flexible as I
can see myself using a basic python emailer pretty regularly.<p>
  <p>
Overall I'm pretty happy with the results. I want to add something to my bash
that will call the main.py script every day at, say, 12pm.<p>

<b> EDIT: </b> It looks like
<a href='https://github.com/dbader/schedule' target='blank'>schedule<img class="new-window" src='static/new_window.png' title="new tab" alt="opens in new tab"></a>
 can do this well. I'll have to look into
that more soon.
